I used parameters 
-patient_experience_national_comp (reflects the patients' rating of
hospital) and 
-hospital_overall_rating (reflects overal rating of the hospital)
from "Hospital General Information".
The query:
select * from ove_rating_patient_surv limit 50;

attempts to find out if there is a correlation between independent hospital
overal rating and the survey responses obtained from patients:
MARION REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER	Above the National average	5
LAKELAND COMMUNITY HOSPITAL	Same as the National average	5
BAPTIST MEDICAL CENTER EAST	Above the National average	5
MAYO CLINIC HOSPITAL	Above the National average	5
BANNER HEART HOSPITAL	Above the National average	5
ARKANSAS SURGICAL HOSPITAL	Above the National average	5
COMMUNITY HOSPITAL OF THE MONTEREY PENINSULA	Above the National average
5
METHODIST HOSPITAL OF SOUTHERN CA	Same as the National average	5
SCRIPPS MEMORIAL HOSPITAL LA JOLLA	Above the National average	5
GOLETA VALLEY COTTAGE HOSPITAL	Above the National average	5
SANTA BARBARA COTTAGE HOSPITAL	Above the National average	5
SCRIPPS GREEN HOSPITAL	Above the National average	5
MERCY REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER	Above the National average	5
SARASOTA MEMORIAL HOSPITAL	Above the National average	5

NORTHSIDE MEDICAL CENTER	Above the National average	5
STRAUB CLINIC AND HOSPITAL	Above the National average	5
ST LUKE'S REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER	Above the National average	5
ADVENTIST LA GRANGE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL	Above the National average	5
CENTEGRA HEALTH SYSTEM - MC HENRY HOSPITAL	Above the National average
5
RIVERSIDE MEDICAL CENTER	Above the National average	5
ADVOCATE CONDELL MEDICAL CENTER	Same as the National average	5
ADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD HOSPITAL	Same as the National average	5
ST CATHERINE HOSPITAL INC	Same as the National average	5
FRANCISCAN HEALTH MOORESVILLE	Above the National average	5
 
It looks like the two parameters do correlate.

It might be better if both parameters are ordinal (so one  would convert the
nominal values of patient_experience_national_comp (Above the National Average,Same as the National Average,Below the National Average) into ordinal values 1,2,3)
