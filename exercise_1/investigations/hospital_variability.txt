The "Redmission and Deaths- Hospitals" score parameter used to evaluate the
variability in the measures (30 days readmission rates, 30 days mortality
rates,death rates for selected health conditions)  among the hospitals.
The question is answered by using the query:
select measure_name, cast(STDDEV(rating) as decimal(5,2)) std_rating,
cast(avg(rating) as decimal(5,2)) ave_rating from proced_var group by
measure_name order by (std_rating*100/ave_rating) DESC;


RESULT:
Death rate for CABG                       0.87              3.33 
Death rate for chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD) patients	  1.11               8.08
Pneumonia (PN) 30-Day Mortality Rate	  2.1	             16.4
Heart failure (HF) 30-Day 
Mortality Rate	                          1.46	             12.16
Rate of readmission after hip/knee 
replacement	                          0.55	             4.61
Death rate for stroke patients	          1.66	             14.93
Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) 
30-Day Mortality Rate	                  1.25	             14.06
Rate of readmission for stroke patients	  1.07	             12.56
Pneumonia (PN) 30-Day Readmission Rate	  1.43	             17.11
Rate of readmission for CABG	          1.13	             14.41
Heart failure (HF) 30-Day Readmission 
Rate	                                  1.5	             21.95
Rate of readmission for chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD) patients                           1.27	             20
Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) 
30-Day Readmission Rate	                  0.96	             16.89
Rate of readmission after discharge 
from hospital (hospital-wide)	          0.82               15.58

Results above are for (1) standard deviation and (2) average scores.
The measures are listed in the %CV(coefficient of variability) order ranging
from max of 18% for Death rate for CABG and min of ~5% for Rate of readmission
after discharge from hospital (hospital-wide), also see Q3_measures_variability.png file,
